[Artipie roadmap](https://github.com/orgs/artipie/projects/3) on the second quarter:
 * validate README files in all our projects. All files should have actual description and worked links.
 * implement Hex repository's adapter. The adapter will allow hostingÂ private Erlang / Elixir packages using artipie as repositories manager.
 * implement ability to plug in a custom storage. This feature will allow using a custom storage to host binary data with no changes in artipie module.
